## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Dynamic font sizes

### What I learned

I used this project to experiment with the clamp property and some responsive techniques. I set clamp on things that I wanted to scale with the viewport, and I was more mindful of what units I used where (such as em for padding and margin and rem for font-sizes).

I also learned ways to optimize your site, such as converting images from jpg or png to webp (though I couldn't get around to doing this).

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn responsive design, reinforce CSS fundamentals, and begin learning Javascript in depth.
